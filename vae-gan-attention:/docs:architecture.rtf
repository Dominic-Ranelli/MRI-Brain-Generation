# VAE-GAN Architecture with Attention

## Overview

Model uses two-part architecture:

— Variational Autoencoder (VAE): Encodes input medical images into a latent space and reconstructs them.
— GAN Discriminator: Judges real vs. generated images, improving realism.
— Attention Modules: Enhance decoder’s ability to focus on important spatial/semantic features.

## Components

— Encoder: Convolutional layers + ReLU, encodes into mean and log variance
— Latent Sampling: z = mu + sigma * epsilon
— Decoder: Upsampling layers with optional attention
— Discriminator: Trains adversarially to guide output toward realism

## Loss Functions

— VAE Loss = MSE (Reconstruction) + KL Divergence
— GAN Loss = Binary Cross Entropy between fake/real images
